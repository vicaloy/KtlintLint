# 📏 Custom Lint Rule for Android using Hamcrest

This project demonstrates how to create a custom Lint rule for Android development, leveraging Hamcrest for flexible and expressive testing. Lint rules help enforce coding standards and detect potential issues in Android projects, ensuring code quality and consistency.

##  🚀 Features
- Custom Lint Rule: Detects specific code patterns or potential issues in Android projects.
- Hamcrest Integration: Utilizes Hamcrest matchers to create clear and maintainable test assertions for the Lint rule.
- Static Code Analysis: Ensures adherence to best practices and helps maintain clean code.

##  🛠️ Technologies Used
- Kotlin/Java: Core programming languages for the Lint rule.
- Lint API: Android's Lint framework to analyze code and define custom rules.
- Hamcrest: Provides matchers for creating expressive and readable assertions.
- Android Studio/IntelliJ: IDEs for development and testing.
